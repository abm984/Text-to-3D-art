# Text-to-3D-art

The use of Stable Diffusion and Generative AI models has advanced e productivity and creativity in more than just limited to Prompting. The ideal Prompting and attention mechanism has developed a perfect scenario for challenging this Task and building the AI more at an advanced level of AI. Today I’m here to show you the building of AI 3D art and object files with few shots of prompting. The ideal Shape-E has already a repository available for it’s content for Text to 3D art using text but now we are available with the facility of Major Technology of Stable Diffusion and Generative AI

For building this art I’ve to proceed with Hugging Face Stable Diffusion models. that are available. As we know the V: 2.1 Stable diffusion model is way more innovative and Best of all. but at this time we are using Stable Diffusion 1.5 to enhance the possibility of making it more progressive in the depth of this.

I had put an following Prompt as positive

Prompt:

dystopian style Shadow Play, Fujifilm X100 . bleak, post-apocalyptic, somber, dramatic, highly detailed, detailed face, masterpiece picture of a young woman, Petite, toned, body, Modest Proportions breast, Crop top, Ripped skinny jeans, studded leather jacket, band t-shirt, combat boots, spiked choker, capturing the spirit of exploration, Derelict Office Lobby, Extreme wide-angle
Negative prompt:

ugly, deformed, noisy, blurry, low contrast, cheerful, optimistic, vibrant, colorful, blurry eyes, two heads, two faces, plastic, Deformed, blurry, bad anatomy, bad eyes, crossed eyes, poorly drawn face, mutation, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, blurry, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, blur, out of focus, long neck, long body, mutated hands and fingers, out of frame, blender, doll, cropped, low-res, close-up, poorly-drawn face, out of frame double, blurred, ugly, disfigured, too many fingers, deformed, repetitive, grainy, extra limbs, bad anatomy, airbrush, zoomed, deformed, extra limbs, extra fingers, mutated hands, bad anatomy, bad proportions, blind, bad eyes, ugly eyes, dead eyes, vignette, out of shot, out of focus, gaussian, closeup, monochrome, grainy, noisy, text, writing, watermark, logo, over saturation, over shadow, negatveXL, unaestheticXLv1

The Generative AI Image is created from This Hugging Face Model

If we use the same image for the rendering process that would fall into a Fail challenge at all. So introducing removing background is the appropriate approach. The best inductive model must has no background. So i created a Pipeline to remove the Background and settle the things up for just a Simple Model Pic.


After Remove of Back-Ground.

After this point, I have introduced the best model checkpoint as pertains to rendering this image file into 3D model file.


3D model.obj file

So just in few shots of Code due to AI and ML. You can generate your model AI Avatar from just text.
